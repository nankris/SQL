The reasons is because the DB is designed in a star\nstructure - one table (Match) with all the \"performance\" and metrics, but only keys and IDs,\nwhile all the descriptive information stored in other tables (Country, League, Team)\n\nNote that Team is joined twice. This is a tricky one, as while we are using the same table name, we basically bring two different copies (and rename them using AS). The reason is that we need to bring information about two different values (home_team_api_id, away_team_api_id), and if we join them to the same table, it would mean that they are equal to each other.\n\nYou will also note that the Team tables are joined using left join.

Instead of looking on the raw data we will start to grouping it to different levels we want to examine.\nIn this example, we will base it on the previous query, remove the match and date information, and look at it at the country-league-season level.\n\nThe functionality we will use for that is GROUP BY, that comes between the WHERE and ORDER\n\nOnce you chose what level you want to analyse, we can devide the select statement to two:\n* Dimensions - those are the values we describing, same that we group by later.\n* Metrics - all the metrics have to be aggregated using functions.. \nThe common functions are: sum(), count(), count(distinct), avg(), min(), max()\n\nNote - it is very important to use the same dimensions both in the select, and in the GROUP BY. Otherwise the output might be wrong.\n\nAnother functionality that can be used after grouping, is HAVING. This adds another layer of filtering the data, this time the output of the table **after** the grouping.

The problem is that while the first table holds one row for each player, the key in the second table is player+season, so if we do a regular join, the result would be a Cartesian product, and each player's basic details would appear as many times as this player appears in the attributes table. The problem with of course is that the average would be skewed towards players that appear many times in the attribute table.\n\nThe solution, is to use a subquery.  We would need to group the attributes table, to a different key - player level only (without season). Of course we would need to decide first how we would want to combine all the attributes to a single row. I used average, but one can also decide on maximum, latest season and etc. \nOnce both tables have the same keys, we can join them together (think of the subquery as any other table, only temporal), knowing that we won't have duplicated rows after the join.\n\nIn addition, you can see here two examples of how to use functions:\n* Conditional function is an important tool for data manipulation. While IF statement is very popular in other languages, SQLite is not supporting it, and it's implemented using CASE + WHEN + ELSE statement. \nAs you can see, based on the input of the data, the query would return different results.\n\n* ROUND - straight sorward.\nEvery SQL languages comes with a lot of usefull functions by default."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cda7c6ea-33af-4155-a2fa-93548aef12e7","_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_uuid":"c0620891169bb5ea3d0de4f800737f40a93c6b03","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"players_height = pd.read_sql(\"\"\"SELECT CASE\n                                        WHEN ROUND(height)<165 then 165\n                                        WHEN ROUND(height)>195 then 195\n                                        ELSE ROUND(height)\n                                        END AS calc_height, \n                                        COUNT(height) AS distribution, \n                                        (avg(PA_Grouped.avg_overall_rating)) AS avg_overall_rating,\n                                        (avg(PA_Grouped.avg_potential)) AS avg_potential,\n                                        AVG(weight) AS avg_weight \n                            FROM PLAYER\n                            LEFT JOIN (SELECT Player_Attributes.player_api_id, \n                                        avg(Player_Attributes.overall_rating) AS avg_overall_rating,\n                                        avg(Player_Attributes.potential) AS avg_potential  \n                                        FROM Player_Attributes\n                                        GROUP BY Player_Attributes.player_api_id) \n                                        AS PA_Grouped ON PLAYER.player_api_id = PA_Grouped.player_api_id\n                            GROUP BY calc_height\n                            ORDER BY calc_height\n                                ;\"\"\", conn)\nplayers_height","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3c06ab2d-d93c-4cf0-a8b8-55df5753e24f","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"391bd233403a29cc9be121f12afcaeae83a20952","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"players_height.plot(x=['calc_height'],y=['avg_overall_rating'],figsize=(12,5),title='Potential vs Height')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
